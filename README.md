# Iran-json
In this project, Iran's provinces are listed as a JSON file, with their svg paths at three different resolution (High, Medium and Low quality).

## Usage
Create a SVG html element with a ``viewBox="0 0 798 724"``, then loop ``<path>`` through provinces.

## License
paths for High and Low resolutions are extracted from SVG maps provided at [amcharts](https://www.amcharts.com/svg-maps/?map=iran), licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License](creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) so is the Iran-json.

Medium resolution was created by me and is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License](creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) also.
